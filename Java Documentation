+	Addition	Adds together two values	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	
/	Division	Divides one value by another
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder		
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

MATH
Math.max(x,y)	Math.min(x,y)	Math.min(x,y)	Math.abs(x)
int randomNum = (int)(Math.random() * 101);  // 0 to 100
Define an If statement
if (condition) { /run code here/ } 
Else
}else{ /run else code here/ }
Loops		break (jumps out of loop)  continue (ends iteration)
While loop -  while (condition) { /run code here/ }
While loop -  for (A start; B end; C increment) { /run code here/ }
Example for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) { /run code here/ }

Arrays [] (start at 0) (To loop in an array, set to (i=0; i<=cars.length; I++)
int[] numberLine = {1, 2, 3, 4}; Get System.out.println(cars[0]);
Define cars[0] = "red"; Length(Int) System.out.println(cars.length);

Multi-Dimensional Arrays [][] (To loop in double array, double loops)
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
(Get to 2nd array, then 3rd Element) int x = myNumbers[1][2];	(7)

Methods (Function)
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {/code to be executed/}	
} (myMethod()
 Name of method)(static means that method belongs toMain class and not object)(void means their is no return data) 		Call Function myMethod(); 

Method overloading (same name with(must) different parameters)
Method overloading is using the same name but the parameters must have unique requirements
static int plusMethod(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}
static double plusMethod(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}
  int myNum1 = plusMethod(8, 5); 		(Calls only one)
  double myNum2 = plusMethod(4.3, 6.26); 	(Calls only one)
Scope
Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method following the line of code in which they were declared, but not beyond itself
Recursion (Method calling itself; rabbithole)
Breaking problems down into simple problems to solve
Example
public static int sum(int start, int end) {
    if (end > start) {
      return end + sum(start, end - 1);
    } else {
      return end;
    }
  }
The Halting problem
The Halting problem is a computer problem where a function never ends; uses up computer power, caused by a unsolvable task, like divided by 0
Value Types int myNum = 5;  Integer (whole num) / float myFloatNum = 5.99f; Floating point number / char myLetter = 'D'; Character /  boolean myBool = true;  Boolean /  String myText = "Hello"; String
